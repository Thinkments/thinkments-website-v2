Pain Point 1 (The Black Box): You're spending a small fortune on marketing, but you can't confidently connect it to revenue. It feels like you're feeding a slot machine.
•
Pain Point 2 (The Identity Crisis): Your team is busy, but not aligned. Your messaging is inconsistent, and your "random acts of marketing" aren't adding up to a bigger picture.
•
Pain Point 3 (Execution Paralysis): You're stuck in tactical weeds, debating small details while your big strategic goals gather dust.

Section 4: The Solution (Introduce the "Aha!" Moment)

Headline: The problem isn't your tactics. It's the absence of a North Star.
