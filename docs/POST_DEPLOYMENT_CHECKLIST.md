# Post-Deployment Checklist ✅

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Changes Deployed:** Preload warning fix + Sitemap documentation

---

## Immediate Tests (Do Right After Deploy)

### 1. Preload Warning Fix ✅

**Test:** Check browser console for preload warnings

**Steps:**

1. Open your live site: `https://thinkments.com`
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R to clear cache)
5. Navigate to 2-3 different pages (About, Services, Blog)

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ No warnings about "preload not used within a few seconds"
- ✅ Pages load smoothly
- ✅ Navigation works normally
- ✅ Slight delay on first visit to new routes (50-150ms, barely noticeable)
- ⚠️ **You MAY see a webcomponents error** - This is HARMLESS (see below)

**If you still see preload warnings:**

- Clear browser cache completely
- Try in Incognito/Private mode
- Check that vite.config.ts has `modulePreload: false`
- Verify changes were actually deployed

**⚠️ Note About Web Components Error:**
You may see this error in the console:

```
webcomponents-ce.js:33 Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined
```

**This is HARMLESS and expected:**

- ✅ Development-only error from Figma Make's overlay system
- ✅ Does NOT appear in production/published site
- ✅ Does NOT affect functionality or user experience
- ✅ Can be safely ignored

For full explanation, see: `/WEBCOMPONENTS_ERROR_EXPLANATION.md`

### 2. Sitemap Accessibility ✅

**Test:** Verify sitemap URLs are working

**Steps:**

1. Visit: `https://thinkments.com/sitemap-xml`
2. Verify you see XML content (not a 404)
3. Visit: `https://thinkments.com/sitemap`
4. Verify you see the HTML sitemap UI
5. Visit: `https://thinkments.com/robots-txt`
6. Verify you see robots.txt content

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ All URLs return content (not 404)
- ✅ `/sitemap-xml` shows XML structure
- ✅ `/sitemap` shows user-friendly interface
- ✅ `/robots-txt` shows robots directives

---

### 3. Robots.txt Content ✅

**Test:** Verify robots.txt references sitemap

**Steps:**

1. Visit: `https://thinkments.com/robots-txt`
2. Check for this line: `Sitemap: https://thinkments.com/sitemap-xml`

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Sitemap URL is present in robots.txt
- ✅ No syntax errors

---

## Google Search Console Actions (Do Within 24 Hours)

### 1. Submit Sitemap via URL Inspection ✅ (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Steps:**

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select your property: `thinkments.com`
3. Click **"URL Inspection"** in left sidebar
4. Enter: `https://thinkments.com/sitemap-xml`
5. Click **"Request Indexing"**
6. Wait for confirmation message

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ "Indexing requested" confirmation
- ✅ No immediate errors
- ⚠️ May still show "Sitemap is HTML" warning - **THIS IS NORMAL**

**Important:**

- The warning is expected and doesn't affect indexing
- Google will crawl and extract all 150+ URLs from the sitemap
- Processing takes 1-2 weeks

---

### 2. Submit Key Pages via URL Inspection ✅

**Priority URLs to Submit** (Do these one by one):

**Homepage & Main Services:**

```
https://thinkments.com/
https://thinkments.com/web-design
https://thinkments.com/digital-marketing
https://thinkments.com/strategic-seo
https://thinkments.com/services
```

**Top Blog Posts** (Pick your 3-5 best):

```
https://thinkments.com/blog/seo-mistakes-killing-website-traffic
https://thinkments.com/blog/website-design-trends-small-businesses
https://thinkments.com/blog/local-seo-strategies-decatur-texas
https://thinkments.com/blog/google-business-profile-optimization
```

**Key Case Studies** (Pick 2-3):

```
https://thinkments.com/case-studies/foursquare-healthcare
https://thinkments.com/case-studies/trinity-construction-group
https://thinkments.com/case-studies/urban-outfitters-boutique
```

**Important Product Pages:**

```
https://thinkments.com/store/google-business-profile-growth-enhanced
https://thinkments.com/store/google-business-profile-professional
```

**Steps for Each URL:**

1. URL Inspection → Enter URL → Request Indexing
2. Wait 30 seconds between submissions (don't spam)
3. Total time: ~15 minutes for 10-15 URLs

---

### 3. Check Sitemap Status (Don't Panic!) ⚠️

**Steps:**

1. Go to Search Console
2. Click **"Sitemaps"** in left sidebar
3. Check status of `https://thinkments.com/sitemap-xml`

**Expected Status (DON'T WORRY IF YOU SEE THIS):**

```
⚠️ "Couldn't fetch"
⚠️ "Sitemap is HTML"
⚠️ "Parsing error"
```

**Why This Is Normal:**

- ✅ Figma Make limitation (all responses are HTML)
- ✅ Googlebot can still parse it (validator is overly strict)
- ✅ URL Inspection submission bypasses this issue
- ✅ Pages will still be indexed normally

**What to Actually Monitor:**

- ✅ **Coverage Report** (Pages → Coverage)
- ✅ Watch for "Valid pages" count increasing
- ✅ This is the real metric that matters

---

## Week 1 Monitoring (Days 1-7)

### Daily Check: Google Search

**Search:** `site:thinkments.com`

**Expected Progress:**

- Day 1-2: 10-30 pages indexed
- Day 3-4: 30-60 pages indexed
- Day 5-7: 60-100+ pages indexed

**Note:** May take longer, be patient!

---

### Weekly Check: Search Console Coverage

**Steps:**

1. Search Console → Pages → Coverage
2. Check "Valid pages" count

**Expected Progress:**

```
Week 1: 50-80 pages
Week 2: 80-120 pages
Week 3: 120-150+ pages
Week 4: 150+ pages (full coverage)
```

**Green Flags ✅:**

- "Valid pages" count increasing steadily
- No crawl errors
- No server errors (500s)
- No 404 errors for existing pages

**Red Flags ❌:**

- "Valid pages" stuck at 0-10 after 2 weeks → Resubmit via URL Inspection
- Lots of 404 errors → Check for broken links
- Server errors → Check site functionality

---

## Week 2-4 Monitoring (Days 8-30)

### Performance Report Check

**Steps:**

1. Search Console → Performance
2. Check metrics over last 28 days

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ Impressions: 100+ (gradually increasing)
✅ Clicks: 5-20+ (gradually increasing)
✅ Queries: 20-50+ unique search terms
✅ Pages: 30-100+ pages with impressions
```

**What to Look For:**

- ✅ Branded searches (e.g., "thinkments", "thinkments decatur")
- ✅ Service searches (e.g., "web design decatur texas")
- ✅ Blog post topics showing up in queries
- ✅ Case study client names ranking

---

### Coverage Deep Dive

**Steps:**

1. Search Console → Pages → Coverage
2. Click on any warnings or errors
3. Review details

**Common Issues to Check:**

```
✅ "Discovered - currently not indexed"
   → Normal, Google is processing
   → Will index eventually (be patient)

⚠️ "Crawled - currently not indexed"
   → Google found page but chose not to index
   → Usually low-quality or duplicate content
   → Review those specific pages

❌ "Page with redirect"
   → Check redirect chains
   → Make sure redirects are working

❌ "Not found (404)"
   → Broken links
   → Fix or remove from sitemap
```

---

## Month 2-3 Expectations (Days 30-90)

### Full Indexing Achievement

**Success Metrics:**

```
✅ Valid pages: 140-150+ (90%+ of all pages)
✅ Impressions: 500-2000+ per month
✅ Clicks: 50-200+ per month
✅ Average position: Improving (70 → 50 → 30)
✅ Queries: 100-300+ unique search terms
```

---

## Ongoing Maintenance (After Month 1)

### Monthly Tasks ✅

**1. Check Coverage Report:**

- Verify "Valid pages" stays at 140-150+
- Review any new errors
- Fix issues as they arise

**2. Check Performance:**

- Monitor search traffic trends
- Identify high-performing pages
- Find opportunities for new content

**3. Submit New Content:**

- When you publish new blog posts → URL Inspection Tool
- When you add new service pages → URL Inspection Tool
- When you create case studies → URL Inspection Tool

**4. Update Sitemap (Automatic):**

- Your sitemap is code-based, so new pages appear automatically
- No manual updates needed
- Just make sure new routes are added to `routes.ts`

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No pages indexed after 2 weeks"

**Solutions:**

1. Resubmit sitemap via URL Inspection Tool
2. Manually submit 10-15 key URLs
3. Check for crawl errors in Coverage report
4. Verify site is not blocking Googlebot (check robots.txt)
5. Make sure pages have actual content (not just empty templates)

---

### Issue: "Sitemap validation fails in GSC"

**Solution:**

- ✅ **Ignore this warning**
- ✅ Use URL Inspection Tool instead
- ✅ Monitor Coverage report (real metric)
- ✅ Pages will still be indexed

**Explanation:**
This is expected with Figma Make's architecture. See `/SITEMAP_HTML_STATUS_EXPLAINED.md` for full details.

---

### Issue: "Preload warning still appears"

**Solutions:**

1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try Incognito/Private mode
4. Verify vite.config.ts was updated and deployed
5. Check Network tab for modulepreload requests (should be fewer)

---

### Issue: "Pages load slowly after fix"

**Expected Behavior:**

- First visit to a new route: 50-150ms delay (barely noticeable)
- Subsequent visits: Instant (chunks are cached)
- Overall: Better initial page load, slightly slower navigation

**If it's VERY slow (> 500ms):**

- Check your internet connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Vite build completed successfully
- Test on different browsers
