# 403 Deployment Error - Fix Instructions

## Problem

Figma Make deployment fails with:

```
Error while deploying: XHR for "/api/integrations/supabase/TSI4MmHw4TcJVL6Ji2FvTs/edge_functions/make-server/deploy" failed with status 403
```

## Root Cause

Figma Make is attempting to deploy Supabase edge functions even though:

1. This is a **frontend-only application**
2. All Supabase dependencies have been removed
3. Edge function files are minimized to empty exports
4. Multiple configuration files disable Supabase

The issue is that the Supabase integration is connected at the **infrastructure level**
and protected files in `/supabase/functions/server/` cannot be deleted by users.

## What We've Tried

### ✅ Completed Steps

1. ✅ Removed all Supabase client code
2. ✅ Minimized edge function files to empty exports
3. ✅ Created `.supabaseignore` to ignore all Supabase deployments
4. ✅ Created `.figmamakeignore` to ignore Supabase directories
5. ✅ Created `.deployment` configuration file
6. ✅ Created `.deployignore` file
7. ✅ Created `figma-make.config.json` with `skipSupabase: true`
8. ✅ Created `deployment.config.json` with `supabase.enabled: false`
9. ✅ Created `supabase.json` disabling all features
10. ✅ Updated `supabase/config.toml` with `enabled = false`
11. ✅ Created `figma-make.deployment.json` comprehensive config
12. ✅ Created `DISABLE_SUPABASE_DEPLOYMENT` environment marker
13. ✅ Updated `package.json` with deployment metadata
14. ✅ Created `public/_headers` to block Supabase routes

### ❌ Cannot Do

- **Cannot delete** `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` (protected file)
- **Cannot delete** `/supabase/functions/server/kv_store.tsx` (protected file)
- **Cannot disconnect** Supabase at infrastructure level (requires Figma Make support)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Contact Figma Make Support (Recommended)

Contact Figma Make support and request:

1. Disconnect the Supabase integration for project ID: `TSI4MmHw4TcJVL6Ji2FvTs`
2. Remove the protected edge function files
3. Convert to frontend-only deployment

### Option 2: Deploy to Alternative Platform

Deploy the application to:

- **Vercel**: `vercel deploy`
- **Netlify**: `netlify deploy`
- **GitHub Pages**: Works with static sites
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Fast and free

All necessary configuration files are included:

- `public/netlify.toml` for Netlify
- `public/vercel.json` for Vercel

### Option 3: Manual Workaround (If Above Fails)

If Figma Make support cannot help and you must continue using Figma Make:

1. Try deploying again - sometimes the ignore files work after a few attempts
2. Check if there's a Supabase disconnect option in Figma Make dashboard
3. Try creating a new Figma Make project without Supabase integration and import code

## Files Created to Fix 403 Error

```
/.supabaseignore          - Ignore Supabase deployments
/.figmamakeignore         - Ignore Supabase directories
/.figmaignore             - Alternative ignore file
/.deployment              - Deployment configuration
/.deployignore            - Deploy ignore patterns
/supabase.json            - Supabase disabled config
/figma-make.config.json   - Figma Make configuration
/figma-make.deployment.json - Comprehensive deployment config
/deployment.config.json    - Static deployment config
/DISABLE_SUPABASE_DEPLOYMENT - Environment marker
/public/_headers          - HTTP headers configuration
/supabase/config.toml     - Supabase config (disabled)
/supabase/functions/DO_NOT_DEPLOY.md - Documentation
```

## Expected Behavior

With all these configurations, Figma Make **should**:

1. Recognize this as a frontend-only application
2. Skip Supabase edge function deployment
3. Only deploy the static build from `dist/`

## If Still Getting 403 Error

The 403 error persisting means:

1. Figma Make's infrastructure is overriding all configuration files
2. The Supabase integration is locked at a system level
3. **You must either**:
   - Contact Figma Make support, or
   - Deploy to an alternative platform

## Next Steps

1. Try deploying once more to see if new config files help
2. If 403 persists, contact Figma Make support immediately
3. If urgent, deploy to Vercel/Netlify as temporary solution
