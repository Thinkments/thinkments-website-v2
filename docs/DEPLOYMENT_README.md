# ThinkMents Website - Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This is a FRONTEND-ONLY Application

This website is **100% frontend** - no backend, no Supabase, no edge functions.

## Deployment Configuration

### Build Settings

- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`
- **Framework:** Vite + React
- **Type:** Static Site

### ⛔ DO NOT Deploy These:

- ❌ Supabase edge functions
- ❌ Server functions
- ❌ API endpoints
- ❌ Backend services

## Figma Make Deployment Issue (403 Error)

### The Problem

Figma Make is attempting to deploy Supabase edge functions that:

1. Were created during initial setup
2. Are now protected system files
3. Cannot be deleted through normal means
4. Are NOT used by the application

### Configuration Files Created

To prevent edge function deployment:

- `figma-make.config.json` - Disables Supabase integration
- `deployment.config.json` - Specifies static deployment
- `.figmamakeignore` - Ignores Supabase directories
- `.supabaseignore` - Skips all Supabase deployments
- `supabase/config.toml` - Disables edge functions
- `.deployment` - Environment-level configuration

### The Solution

If the 403 error persists after these configurations:

1. **Deploy to Vercel (Recommended - 5 minutes):**

   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel

   # Deploy
   vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder after running `npm run build`
   - Or connect via GitHub/GitLab

3. **Contact Figma Make Support:**
   - Request manual disconnection of Supabase integration
   - Provide project ID: TSI4MmHw4TcJVL6Ji2FvTs
