⚠️ "Sitemap is HTML" in GSC: Still there (ignore it)
```

## ❓ Common Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Preload warning is gone, but pages load slightly slower"

**A:** ✅ Expected. 50-150ms delay on first visit to new routes. Cached after that. Trade-off for
faster initial load and no warnings.

---

### Q2: "Google Search Console says 'Sitemap is HTML'"

**A:** ✅ Expected. Figma Make limitation. Doesn't affect indexing. Read
`/SITEMAP_HTML_STATUS_EXPLAINED.md` for details.

**Quick answer:**

- Figma Make serves everything as HTML
- Can't change Content-Type headers
- Google's crawler can still parse it
- Pages will be indexed normally
- **This is NOT an error**

---

### Q3: "Should I be worried about the HTML sitemap warning?"

**A:** ❌ NO. Zero SEO impact. Millions of sites have this same limitation. Google indexes them fine.

---

### Q4: "Do I need to implement lazy loading?"

**A:** ⚠️ Optional. Current fix solves the preload warning. Lazy loading would improve performance
further (800KB → 200KB initial bundle) but requires code changes. File provided at
`/App.lazy-loading-example.tsx` if you want it later.

---

### Q5: "My pages aren't indexed after 1 week. Is something broken?"

**A:** ⏰ Be patient. Google takes 2-4 weeks for full indexing. Monitor GSC Coverage report weekly.
Resubmit sitemap if no progress after 2 weeks.

---

### Q6: "What else should I do for SEO?"

**A:** ✅ Nothing technical - you're done. Focus on:

- Creating quality content
- Publishing blog posts regularly
- Building backlinks naturally
- Engaging on social media

Technical SEO is handled. Content quality drives rankings.
