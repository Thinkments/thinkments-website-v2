# Deployment Verification Checklist

After deployment (even if you see a 403 error), verify your site is working:

## ✅ Quick Verification

1. **Site Loads**
    - [ ] Main URL opens
    - [ ] No white screen or errors
    - [ ] Logo and navigation visible

2. **Main Pages Work**
    - [ ] Home (`/`)
    - [ ] Services (`/services`)
    - [ ] About (`/about`)
    - [ ] Contact (`/contact`)
    - [ ] Blog (`/blog`)
    - [ ] Case Studies (`/case-studies`)

3. **SEO Pages Work**
    - [ ] `/robots-txt` (shows robots.txt content)
    - [ ] `/sitemap.xml` (shows sitemap UI)
    - [ ] `/sitemap` (shows HTML sitemap)
    - [ ] `/llm-txt` (shows LLM content)

4. **Forms Display**
    - [ ] Contact form visible at `/contact`
    - [ ] Quote form visible at `/get-a-quote`

5. **Styling Works**
    - [ ] Colors, fonts, layout look correct
    - [ ] Buttons are styled
    - [ ] Responsive on mobile

## If All Checked ✅

**YOUR DEPLOYMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL!**

The 403 error you saw was related to unused Supabase edge functions. It does not affect your
frontend application.

## If Something Doesn't Work ❌

Check these files to ensure they were deployed:

- `/dist/index.html`
- `/dist/assets/` (should contain CSS and JS files)

If files are missing, the build may have failed. Check build logs for errors unrelated to Supabase.

## Deployment Status Summary

| Component      | Status           | Notes                      |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Frontend Build | ✅ Should succeed | `npm run build` completes  |
| Static Files   | ✅ Should deploy  | `dist/` directory created  |
| React App      | ✅ Should work    | All pages load correctly   |
| Edge Functions | ❌ 403 error      | Expected - not used        |
| Database       | N/A              | Not needed - frontend only |
| Authentication | N/A              | Not needed - frontend only |

## Next Steps

If everything works (checklist above is all ✅):

- **No action needed** - deployment was successful
- The 403 error can be safely ignored
- Your site is live and fully functional

If something doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Verify build completed successfully (check logs)
4. Ensure routing is configured for client-side navigation
