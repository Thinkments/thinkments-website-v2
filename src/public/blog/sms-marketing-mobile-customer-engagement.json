Clearly communicate value and frequency expectations. Offer incentives for SMS signup such as exclusive discounts or early access.</p>\n\n      <h2>SMS Message Best Practices</h2>\n      <p>Craft effective SMS messages by keeping under 160 characters, leading with value, including clear CTAs, personalizing when possible, providing context and urgency, using links sparingly, and maintaining brand voice. Test message variations to optimize engagement and conversions.</p>\n\n      <h2>SMS Campaign Types</h2>\n      <p>Implement various SMS campaigns including promotional offers and sales, order and shipping updates, appointment reminders, abandoned cart recovery, customer service notifications, event reminders, and birthday/anniversary messages. Balance promotional and transactional messages to maintain engagement.</p>\n\n      <h2>SMS Automation and Integration</h2>\n      <p>Automate SMS workflows for welcome series, abandoned cart recovery, post-purchase follow-up, and re-engagement campaigns.
