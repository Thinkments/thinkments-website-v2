  "content": "<p>Website performance directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and search rankings. One-second delays reduce conversions by 7%, and 53% of mobile users abandon sites taking over 3 seconds to load. Performance optimization is essential for marketing success. This guide teaches comprehensive performance optimization strategies.</p>\n\n      <h2>Measuring Website Performance</h2>\n      <p>Assess current performance using Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, WebPageTest, Chrome DevTools Lighthouse, and Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS). Test from multiple locations and devices to understand real-world performance. Establish baseline metrics before optimization to measure improvements.</p>\n\n      <h2>Image Optimization</h2>\n      <p>Images typically account for 50-70% of page weight. Optimize by compressing images without quality loss, using appropriate formats (WebP, JPEG, PNG), implementing responsive images with srcset, lazy loading below-the-fold images, and using CDNs for delivery. Image optimization often provides the largest performance gains.</p>\n\n      <h2>Code Optimization</h2>\n      <p>Optimize code through minifying CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, removing unused code, combining files when appropriate, deferring non-critical JavaScript, using asynchronous loading, and implementing critical CSS inline. Clean, efficient code loads faster and executes more quickly.</p>\n\n      <h2>Server and Hosting Optimization</h2>\n      <p>Server performance affects loading speeds. Optimize through quality hosting with adequate resources, implementing server-side caching, enabling GZIP or Brotli compression, using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, optimizing database queries, and considering CDNs for asset delivery. Server infrastructure forms the foundation of performance.</p>\n\n      <h2>Monitoring and Maintenance</h2>\n      <p>Maintain performance through regular monitoring, setting performance budgets, testing after changes, addressing regressions promptly, and optimizing continuously. Performance degrades over time without active maintenance. Ongoing monitoring ensures sustained fast experiences.</p>\n\n      <p>Ready to dramatically improve website performance? <a href=\"https://thinkments.com/get-a-quote\" target=\"_blank\">Contact ThinkMents today</a> for expert performance optimization and monitoring.</p>"
