    - A record: `76.76.21.21`
    - Or CNAME: `cname.vercel-dns.com`

**Netlify:**

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: npm"

→ Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

### "Build failed"

→ Run `npm install` first, then `npm run build`

### "Site looks broken"

→ Check that you deployed the `/dist` folder, not the root folder

### "404 on page refresh"

→ Already fixed! Both `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml` are configured for SPA routing

## Which Platform Should I Choose?

**Choose Vercel if:**

- You're familiar with Next.js ecosystem
- You want serverless functions (future use)

**Choose Netlify if:**

- You want form handling out of the box
- You prefer their dashboard UI
- You want built-in split testing

**Honestly?** Both are excellent. Flip a coin. You can't go wrong.

## Still Want to Use Figma Make?

Email their support:

```
Subject: 403 Error - Request to Disconnect Supabase

Project ID: TSI4MmHw4TcJVL6Ji2FvTs
Issue: Edge function deployment fails with 403
Request: Please disconnect Supabase integration

My app is frontend-only and doesn't use Supabase.
```

Then wait 1-3 business days for them to fix it.

**But seriously** - deploying to Vercel/Netlify takes 5 minutes and works perfectly. Why wait?
