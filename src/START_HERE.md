# ⚡ START HERE - 403 Error Solution

## The Problem

Figma Make is trying to deploy Supabase edge functions you don't have permission to deploy.

## Why Configuration Files Don't Work

The Supabase integration exists at **infrastructure level** - Figma Make checks it BEFORE reading
your config files.

## The Only 3 Solutions

### 1. Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

Done. Site is live.

### 2. Deploy to Netlify (5 minutes)

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

Done. Site is live.

### 3. Contact Figma Make Support (1-3 days)

Email them requesting to disconnect Supabase integration for project `TSI4MmHw4TcJVL6Ji2FvTs`.

## Quick Deploy Instructions

See **`DEPLOY_NOW.md`** for detailed step-by-step instructions.

---

## Why This Happened

You restored to a version that had Supabase files, and Figma Make's infrastructure still has the
integration enabled.

## Your Code Is Perfect

The error is 100% a platform limitation, not a problem with your application.

---

## What to Do Right Now

**If you need the site live today:**
→ Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (see `DEPLOY_NOW.md`)

**If you can wait 1-3 days:**
→ Email Figma Make support to disconnect Supabase

**If you're unsure:**
→ Deploy to Vercel NOW (5 minutes), then decide later

✅ All your application code is ready
✅ `vercel.json` - already created for you
✅ `netlify.toml` - already created for you

## Bottom Line
