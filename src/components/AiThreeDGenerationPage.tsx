      question: 'What is AI 3D model generation?',
      answer:
        'AI 3D model generation uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automatically create three-dimensional models from text descriptions, 2D images, or basic sketches. Our proprietary AI technology analyzes input data and generates detailed, accurate 3D models suitable for product visualization, gaming, 3D printing, and e-commerce applications. The AI handles complex geometry creation, texture mapping, and material assignment, which is then refined by our expert 3D artists to ensure professional quality.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to generate a 3D model?',
      answer:
        'Basic 3D model generation typically takes 2-4 business days, while complex models with custom texturing and optimization require 5-7 business days. Our Professional package offers 3-4 day delivery, and we offer rush services (24-48 hours) for urgent projects at an additional cost. The timeline depends on model complexity, polygon count, detail level, texture resolution, and revision requirements. Enterprise clients can access expedited processing with dedicated 3D artists.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What file formats do you provide?',
      answer:
        'We deliver 3D models in all industry-standard formats including OBJ, FBX, GLTF/GLB, STL, USDZ, DAE (Collada), 3DS, and Blend. For e-commerce applications, we provide optimized GLTF and USDZ files for AR viewing. For 3D printing, we deliver STL files with proper wall thickness and manifold geometry. For game engines, we provide FBX files with optimized topology, LOD levels, and PBR textures. Custom format exports are available in Enterprise packages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you create 3D models from product photos?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Our AI technology excels at converting product photos into accurate 3D models through photogrammetry and AI reconstruction. We use advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze multiple product images and generate detailed 3D models with correct proportions, textures, and materials. For best results, provide 5-10 high-quality photos from different angles with consistent lighting. We can work with as few as 2-3 photos, though more images improve accuracy and detail.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are the 3D models optimized for web use?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely! All our 3D models are optimized for web performance with compressed textures (using Draco or Basis compression), efficient polygon counts, and proper LOD (Level of Detail) implementation. We provide models in GLTF/GLB format optimized for Three.js, Babylon.js, and other web 3D frameworks. Models typically range from 50KB to 2MB ensuring fast loading times while maintaining visual quality. We also provide web viewer embed codes for easy integration.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the 3D models for 3D printing?',
      answer:
        'Yes, we create print-ready 3D models optimized for various 3D printing technologies including FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), SLA (Stereolithography), and SLS (Selective Laser Sintering). Our models feature manifold geometry (water-tight meshes), proper wall thickness (minimum 2mm for FDM), no non-manifold edges, and support structure compatibility. We provide STL files tested for printability with recommended print settings, orientation, and infill patterns.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What industries do you serve?',
      answer:
        'We serve a wide range of industries including e-commerce businesses (product visualization), game developers (asset creation), product designers (prototyping), manufacturers (technical modeling), architects (visualization), educators (3D learning materials), marketing agencies (3D advertising), AR/VR companies (immersive experiences), furniture retailers (room planners), fashion brands (virtual try-on), automotive (configurators), and metaverse platforms (virtual goods). Our AI 3D generation technology adapts to any industry requiring professional 3D models.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer revisions?',
      answer:
        'Yes! All packages include revisions. Our Starter package includes 2 revision rounds, Professional includes 4 revisions, and Enterprise includes unlimited revisions. Revisions cover geometry adjustments, texture modifications, color changes, material updates, and format conversions. We work closely with you through our collaborative review platform to ensure the final 3D model meets your exact specifications and quality standards. Typical revision turnaround is 1-2 business days.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is your pricing structure?',
      answer:
        'Our pricing starts at $299 for basic 3D models (Starter package - up to 50K polygons, 2K textures), $899 for professional models with advanced features (Professional package - up to 150K polygons, 4K PBR textures, AR optimization), and $2,499+ for enterprise-level custom solutions with dedicated support (Enterprise package - unlimited complexity, animations, API integration). Volume discounts available for 10+ models. Pricing depends on model complexity, polygon count, texture resolution, animation requirements, and delivery timeline. Custom quotes provided within 24 hours.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you create animated 3D models?',
      answer:
        'Yes, we create animated 3D models with rigging, skinning, weight painting, and motion capture integration. Our AI can generate character rigs (bipedal, quadrupedal, custom), product animations (rotation, exploded views, assembly), and interactive demonstrations. Animated models are delivered with skeletal rigs compatible with Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, Maya, and other 3D software. Animation services are included in Professional and Enterprise packages.

                <p>
                  <strong>AI 3D model generation</strong> represents a revolutionary shift in how
                  businesses create digital assets. By combining advanced machine learning
                  algorithms with computer vision technology, our platform can transform simple
                  product photos or text descriptions into fully realized, production-ready 3D
                  models in a fraction of the time required by traditional 3D modeling methods.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-foreground text-2xl">What Makes AI 3D Generation Different?</h3>
                <p>
                  Traditional <strong>3D modeling services</strong> require skilled artists to
                  manually create every vertex, edge, and polygon. This process can take weeks for
                  complex models and costs thousands of dollars. Our{' '}
                  <strong>AI-powered 3D generation technology</strong> automates much of this
                  process, analyzing reference images to understand object geometry, textures, and
                  materials, then generating accurate 3D models with proper topology and UV mapping.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-foreground text-2xl">Applications of AI-Generated 3D Models</h3>

                  model includes proper topology with quad-based geometry, optimized polygon counts
                  for performance, multiple LOD (Level of Detail) levels, PBR (Physically Based
                  Rendering) textures, and efficient UV layouts. We support everything from low-poly
                  mobile game assets to high-fidelity AAA game models.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-foreground text-2xl">3D Printing and Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>
                  Our <strong>3D printable model design service</strong> creates STL files optimized
                  for various 3D printing technologies. Each model features manifold geometry
